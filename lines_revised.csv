Let me know if you would like to continue to heaven or you desire to get off to the top spot.,,,,,,,
"Looks like they have been doing avalanche control, because I just found a bombshell!",,,,,,,
Maybe I'm a snowflake… I think I'm falling for you.,,,,,,,
Most ladies are in the single line. Do you wanna join them?,,,,,,,
My love for you is like the avalanche. Your love makes me fall all over you.,,,,,,,
My rail slides really well.,,,,,,,
"Not to brag, but I've got pretty amazing edge control.",,,,,,,

Starring at your attractive facial outlook made me have a greater edge control today.,,,,,,,
Stick with me you won't just ride black diamonds. You will wear them.,,,,,,,
The lift guy just stopped the ride so we can know more about ourselves.,,,,,,,
The snow was wetter than usual today. Wonder why.,,,,,,,
The snow way of life is with you.,,,,,,,
"The weather is calling for 5 inches, well because they haven't seen the 12 inches I have for you tonight.",,,,,,,
The weather's calling for 5 inches… But I can show you 12.,,,,,,,
There's snow way I'm not getting your number!,,,,,,,
They say I've got an ava-lung because I never come up for air.,,,,,,,
They're saying the piste is gonna freeze and get real hard tonight. Do you know what else will?,,,,,,,
"This lift is too slow, I know a much better way to raise us all the way up to Cloud 9.",,,,,,,
This Pow isn't as sweet as you are.,,,,,,,
This snow pack isn’t the only thing that’s hard,,,,,,,
"Uh oh, it's getting colder. We might need to share body heat.",,,,,,,

"You know, I've got an extra pair of knee pads in my lodge.",,,,,,,
You making my stomach do quad corks.,,,,,,,

I won’t take your love for granite.,,,,,,,
I’m falling for you.,,,,,,,
I’m hanging onto you.,,,,,,,
I'd love to jam that crack,,,,,,,
"If I told you I was falling hard, would you be my belayer?",,,,,,,

"My portaledge sleeps two, you know.",,,,,,,
Need a belay?,,,,,,,
Nice rack.,,,,,,,
Nothing turns me on more than a long hard rock and some tuber.,,,,,,,
Rock under the fingers beats a rock on a finger.,,,,,,,
So do you want to go climbing for a couple of hours and then screw?,,,,,,,
"Some climbers get off soloing; me, I'd rather play with your rack.",,,,,,,
Soo...I have a 6 foot wingspan.,,,,,,,
"Spread your legs, and trust the rubber.",,,,,,,
"Sure you can figure 8, but can you follow through?",,,,,,,
"The thing I like about cracks: The deeper you get, the better it feels. ",,,,,,,
They don't call me a hard man for nothing.,,,,,,,
"Those must be climbing pants, because I would love to climb in your pants.",,,,,,,
"Usually I lead, but I would follow you anywhere.",,,,,,,
Violets are blue. Roses are red. I hear that you give really good belay.,,,,,,,
Wanna get tied up and high?,,,,,,,

We’re not allowed to touch the volleyball more than three times but I’d love to do that to you.,,,,,,,
"Whenever I see you dive, I get turned on, would you mind doing that for me once more, baby?",,,,,,,
Why set and spike when we could just bump uglies?,,,,,,,
Why should we set and even spike if we can just bump away all the uglies we’ve been through.,,,,,,,
Would it be okay to touch you more than 3 times?,,,,,,,
Wow seeing you dive really turns me on.,,,,,,,
"You are so tall I bet you play with the ball, I bet you’d love to test it out with me, right away.",,,,,,,
"You bet I can serve as good as I can go down on my knees for a hit, want to see me do that?",,,,,,,

You must be the perfect set because I hate seeing that so I’d have to smash you real hard.,,,,,,,
You must be wearing something good cause my volleyball does not get blocked that easily!,,,,,,,
You must got a lot of stamina as a volleyball player. Let me test your limit babe.,,,,,,,
"You play volleyball? Let me grab some knee pads, so I can slide into your DMs.",,,,,,,
"You saw how good I am at receiving a volleyball, I bet I can do so with your balls tonight.",,,,,,,
"You seem to be good at volleyball and good enough to go on your knees, can I try it out.",,,,,,,
"You seem to have great knowledge of that swing block, want to try swinging with me as well?",,,,,,,

Have you ever driven a boat? Try to park it on my dock.,,,,,,,
"Hey baby, wanna go for a ride on my big dinghy",,,,,,,
Would you like to sip on a margarita laying on a boat watching a sunset on a calm night?,,,,,,,
